Download dataset (Kaggle) : Landslide4Sense This project focuses on automatically detecting landslides using satellite images and deep learning. It uses a special model called U-Net to find and map areas affected by landslides. The study combines three types of satellite data: images from Sentinel-2, slope data from ALOS PALSAR, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data also from ALOS PALSAR. By using the patches of landslide satellite images the detection has been done.

The method brings together these different data sources to create a strong detection system. The U-Net model analyzes the combined information to accurately identify landslide areas. The satellite images show how the surface reflects light, while the slope and DEM data give important information about the landâ€™s shape, helping to identify landslide features. The results show that using different satellite data with deep learning is effective for detecting landslides, making it a useful tool for managing disasters, assessing risks, and monitoring the environment.
